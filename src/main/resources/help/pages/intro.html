        <h1>Welcome to OpenSeSim, the Stock Market Simulator</h1>
        <p>
            OpenSeSim lets you create trading bots, each following a strategy 
            you choose, and watch them compete against each other in a dynamic 
            stock market. Prices aren’t based on historical data — instead, 
            the bots themselves set prices through supply and demand, 
            creating a truly living market
        </p>
        <p>
        With OpenSeSim, you can effortlessly pit 100,000 bots—or even more, 
        if you like—against each other (even if it doesn’t always make 
        practical sense!). On an older PC, OpenSeSim can still handle 
        100,000 to 200,000 trades per second, and on newer machines, 
        it can do even more. Watch as your bots create a fast-paced, 
        ever-changing market that’s entirely driven by their own actions.
